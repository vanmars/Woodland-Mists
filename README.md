# _Woodland Mists Music Festival Line-Up_

_30 September 2020_

#### _Web app for a fictional music festival_

#### By _**Alma Frankenstein, Donny Mays, and Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

This is a practice exercise for Epicodus to practice working with nested classes, routing, and test-driven development in Ruby. The original instructions include:

_Create a website for a local festival in the woods. A user should be able to create, read, update and delete a Stage and should also be able to create, read, update and delete an Artist. Artists belong to Stages. For the purposes of this project, an Artist can only perform on a single Stage - otherwise, we'd need to use a many-to-many relationship, which is much more complicated._

_Start with unit tests and get all tests passing before starting on integration testing and Sinatra. Make sure integration tests cover all the ways a user may navigate through your pages._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Clone this project using the 'git clone' command in terminal/command line.
- Navigate to the cloned folder and run 'bundle' in your command line.
- Open the cloned repo in a text editor of your choice.
- To run tests: While in the root directory of the project, run 'rspec' in your command line.
